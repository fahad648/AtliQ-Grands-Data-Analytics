  <h1>AtliQ Grands Data Analytics</h1>

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the hospitality industry, owns multiple five-star hotels across India. Despite their 20 years of excellence, they are currently facing challenges due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, resulting in a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. To address these challenges, the managing director has decided to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. Without an in-house data analytics team, they have hired a third-party service provider to derive insights from their historical data.</p>

  <h2>Project Objectives</h2>

    <li><strong>Dashboard Creation:</strong> Design an interactive and visually appealing dashboard using Power BI.</li>
    <li><strong>Insight Generation:</strong> Identify additional insights that are not specified in the metric list or mock-up.</li>
